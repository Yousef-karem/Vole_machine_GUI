Vole Machine GUI
A graphical user interface (GUI) application developed with Qt,
designed using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to provide an interactive platform for managing and controlling the "Vole Machine" operations.

üìú Overview
The Vole Machine GUI is a cross-platform application built using Qt, a powerful C++ framework that supports the WOCA (Write Once, Compile Anywhere) principle. This project uses OOP principles to create a modular, maintainable, and scalable interface, enabling users to interact seamlessly with the machine's functionalities.

‚ú® Features
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux with the same codebase.
Object-Oriented Design: Designed with OOP principles for better code organization, reuse, and scalability.
Intuitive GUI: User-friendly interface designed for easy navigation and operation.
Real-Time Data Display: Visualize machine data and operations in real-time.
Customizable Controls: Adjust settings and parameters dynamically through the GUI.
Logging and Monitoring: Record and monitor machine activities for analysis.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
GUI Framework: Qt (C++ framework)
Programming Language: C++ with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Cross-Platform Build: Supports WOCA (Write Once, Compile Anywhere) for building on multiple platforms.

üìö Usage
For End Users:

Open the application and navigate through the user interface.
Utilize various controls to manage and monitor the Vole Machine.
For Developers:

The codebase is organized using OOP principles, making it easier to extend and maintain.
Fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests to enhance the application.
